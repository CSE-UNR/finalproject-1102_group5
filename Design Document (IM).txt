Prompt user if they want to save the image to a file

	If yes, prompt for a file name

		Get file name 

		Open  the received file to write

		Convert all characters to Brightness Levels through case selection

			If character is “ “, Brightness level is 0

			If character is “.“, Brightness level is 1

			If character is “o“, Brightness level is 2

			If character is “O“, Brightness level is 3

			If character is “0“, Brightness level is 4

		Store all Brightness Levels in the file

		Close file

	Repeat till user exits






loadImage

	Prompt for filename and store in a variable

	Open file through variable to read

		If unable to open display error

		Else read and store all “pixels” 

			Repeat till pc doesn’t “see” anymore rows

				Repeat till pc doesn’t “see” anymore columns

					Read/store Brightness Value

	Close file

	Display all characters through a case selection

		If  the Brightness Value is 0, display “ “

		If the Brightness Value is 1, display “.”

		If the Brightness Value is 2,display “o”

		If the Brightness Value is 3, display “O”

		If the Brightness Value is 4, display “0”






displayImage

	Open predetermined file to read

	Read and store all Brightness Values from the file

	Close file

	Display all characters through a case selection

		If  the Brightness Value is 0, display “ “

		If the Brightness Value is 1, display “.”

		If the Brightness Value is 2,display “o”

		If the Brightness Value is 3, display “O”

		If the Brightness Value is 4, display “0”





editImage

	Display menu for user to do a task (Crop, Dim, Brighten)

	Execute task user chooses

	Use displayImage task to display the new image




cropImage

	Prompt user for location of new top left corner

	Store new location in variable

	Prompt user for location of new top right corner

	Store new location in variable

	Prompt user for location of new bottom left corner

	Store new location in variable

	Prompt user for location of new bottom right corner

	Store new location in variable

	Display new image using the new “Boundaries”

		If  the Brightness Value is 0, display “ “

		If the Brightness Value is 1, display “.”

		If the Brightness Value is 2,display “o”

		If the Brightness Value is 3, display “O”

		If the Brightness Value is 4, display “0”






dimImage

	Open predetermined file to read

	Read and store all Brightness Values from the file

	Close the file 

	Decrement all Brightness Values down by 1 

	Display all characters through a case selection

		If  the Brightness Value is 0, display “ “

		If the Brightness Value is 1, display “.”

		If the Brightness Value is 2,display “o”

		If the Brightness Value is 3, display “O”

		If the Brightness Value is 4, display “0”





brightenImage

	Open predetermined file to read

		Read and store all Brightness Values from the file

		Close the file 

		Increment all Brightness Values up by 1 

		Display all characters through a case selection

			If  the Brightness Value is 0, display “ “

			If the Brightness Value is 1, display “.”

			If the Brightness Value is 2,display “o”

			If the Brightness Value is 3, display “O”

			If the Brightness Value is 4, display “0”

Potential Changes

Add a Render/Display task that does the rendering (If Brightness is X, display 1)
